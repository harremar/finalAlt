For my final project in NEWM-N315 I was assigned to create a coffee maker website inspired by this website: 
https://www.keurig.com/c/coffeemakers101?cm_sp=bo+cybermonday21-_-promo+hero+banner-_-shop+coffee+makers

My task was to create a home page with minumin of 10 coffee makers, a login page with firebase authentication, and a cart page that would display all the items that were choosen on the home page and add p the total. I had to use the MVC model to injection new things into the app allowing me to have an one-page navigation. I also had to make sure my site is full response and would be friendly to use on any device.

To get to the login page click the person icon located of the right corner of the screen to take you to the login/signup page. There you would be able to create an account that would be remember in firebase and would be able to log in. When you are logged in you should get an alert telling you that you are login in and the person icon would turn into an log out button which the user could click to log out of the site.

When the user is login they are able to buy coffee makers which would be displayed on the cart page. You can get to the cart page by clicking the cart icon in the right hand corner. It also keeps track of how many coffee makers you have and get the total at the end. When on the cart page you have an option to delete all or purchase your cart. When you do this you should get two different alerts and the cart would be emptyed out and turned back to zero.

If the user is not login they won't be able to buy a coffee maker. The site would alert the user that they must be signed in inorder to buy one.

For each product they have an image, name, price, and buy now button. I got all of this information from my data.json and got it to loop in my app.js. I put this information into json to hold it in the computer's memory, so when you refresh everything should be saved onto the page.
